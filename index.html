      <p>and the beginning of becoming stems back into university, when I applied for the School of
        Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University (SFU). The program nutured my interested that
        after graduation I pursued a career in UX Design. The pursuit eventually led to work as a UX Designer in
        Rakuten Inc.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-12 p-1 animated fadeInLeft text-center">
      One of the hallmark product I released was Rakuten Wallet, launched in April 2019. It's a Cryptocurrency
      trading service within Rakuten.</div>

    <div class="col-12 p-1 text-center">
      <div class="wow animated fadeInLeftimage-wrapper"><img class="image" src="img/Crypto/workshop.JPG"
          alt="workshop" /></div>
      We began with a 2-day workshop to align the project members of the
      business team, the creative team, and the development team on what product we are building for.
    </div>

    <div class="col-12 p-1 text-center">As a result of the workshop, we identified our development direction to
      focus. With everyone's consensus I created personas and customer journey maps to affirm with
      the stakeholders how users will experience the app.</div>

    <div class="col-12 p-1">After a few more meetings and polishing the CJM we stepped into
      developing the app. Working closely with members of the app development team and the UI Designer we worked
      on the app and completed the app on-time despite several modifications of the criteria along the way.</div>

    <div class="col-12 p-1">This is Rakuten Wallet, a cryptocurrency app where a user can do simple cryptocurrency
      exchange on a easy-to-use interface. The design is based on a physical wallet, where each card represents a
      cryptocurrency and is initially stacked in a way where you can peek at the status of your cryptocurrency
      balance.</div>

    <div class="col-12">There are more works I could present but that'll be for another time. <a href="#"> Tell me
        more. </a></div>

  <div id="Maker" class="row m-0  windowHeight">
    <div class="col-12 p-1">
      <h1>I am a Maker</h1>
      <p> One of the things I loved to do the most while studying for the Bachelor of Arts at SFU was to tinker
        electronics for the assignments. After graduation that passion of making things never died that it has
        become one of the many hobbies of mine that I partake and make things that hasn't existed yet.</p>

  <div id="Seeker" class="row m-0  windowHeight">
    <div class="col-12 p-1">
      <h1>I am a Problem Seeker</h1>
      <p>Whether it is waiting in line at the cafeteria at work, or just living in a small apartment in Japan, I
        see
        something that needs improvement and I would act upon how I could possibly improve the experience. </p>

        <p> My blood runs in Maple Syrup and I love going to Tim Horton's for a nice double-double (Coffee with 2
          cream, 2 sugar). I am currently working in Japan, married with 2 awesome sons. If you're interested
