            <h1>I am a Designer</h1>
            <p>The beginning of being a designer stems back into university, when I applied for the School of
              Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University (SFU). The program nutured my interested that
              after graduation I pursued a career in UX Design. The pursuit eventually led to work as a UX Designer in
              Rakuten Inc.</p>

          <div class="col-12 p-1 text-center">
            One of the hallmark product I released was Rakuten Wallet, launched in April 2019. It's a Cryptocurrency trading service within Rakuten.</div> 
            
            <div class="col-12 p-1 text-center">We began with a working Proof-of-concept prototype in 3 months time in order for the project to be greenlit for commercialization.</div>

          </div>
            <div class="col-12">from various stakeholders we held a 2-day workshop to align the project members of the business team, the creative team, and the development team on what product we are building for.</div>
          <div class="col-12">In the midst of development, I noticed miscommunication had begun to slow development and did a quick investigation to realize that there was no set workflow/ verification check of the production. I immediately held an emergency meeting with all the stakeholders to identify the problem and set out a solution to prevent further errors amongst each other. Since then development continued without a hitch.</div>

            <h1>I am a Maker</h1>
            <p> One of the things I loved to do the most while studying for the Bachelor of Arts at SFU was to tinker
              electronics for the assignments. After graduation that passion of making things never died that it has
              become one of the many hobbies of mine that I partake and make things that hasn't existed yet.</p>

            <h1>I am a Problem Seeker</h1>
            <p>Whether it is waiting in line at the cafeteria at work, or just living in a small apartment in Japan, I
              see
              something that needs improvement and I would act upon how I could possibly improve the experience. </p>

            <span class="col-10">
              <p> This is one of the most definitive point of whom I identify myself as if you ask about me. In a world
                where ethnicity and nationality is intermixed,
                there has been times when people had asked if I'm Chinese and I'd respond to them that I'm a Canadian.
                Born
                and raised in Canada, the only relation to China is my lineage of which I was born to parents from Hong
                Kong.
