I am a Designer
and what led me to choose this path as a career began with my entry as a university student at Simon Fraser University. At Simon Fraser University (SFU) I studied design not knowing what it was at first as I was more interested in Game Design, which was a part of the overall cirriculum, but as I studied I became more interested in the world of design, particularly as a UX designer. So when I graudated I wanted to pursue a career in this field. That led me to Rakuten.

At Rakuten
In Oct. 2015, I entered Rakuten Inc. as a junior designer. I was briefly led by a mentor to get used to the company before becoming assigned to a certain service where I used my knowledge from my university days and applied it to my work.

After multiple projects involving researching the service, creating personas and user journey maps, My biggest achievement to date was taking the lead to create a new service in Rakuten called Rakuten Wallet.

Internally in my department I was a part of a committee to help other employees incubate their ideas to hopefully become a new service within Rakuten.

I am a Maker
While working as a UX Designer professionally, on the side I was very interested with Making things. This is thanks once again to my studies in SFU. One of the major foundations of this push was HCI.
